# CUBE WARS — COMPLETE PROJECT BLUEPRINT
# (Unified Design Document)

============================================================
= 1. HIGH‑LEVEL VISION
============================================================

Cube Wars is a long‑form, macro‑focused, sci‑fi RTS + city‑builder hybrid.
It blends the economic depth of Stellaris, Timberborn, Starmancer, and Anno
with the combat systems of Age of Empires, Command & Conquer, and tower defense.

The core fantasy:
- Build and manage a thriving sci‑fi colony.
- Develop a deep, multi‑layered economy with refinement chains.
- Command large armies in medium‑paced, tactical combat.
- Survive threats, expand territory, and optimize endlessly.
- Play skirmish matches or handcrafted campaign missions.
- Experience rude, funny, light‑hearted sci‑fi storytelling.

The game is designed to be:
- Simple early, complex late.
- Moderate difficulty.
- Macro‑heavy.
- Long‑form (40–90+ minutes, potentially endless).
- Expandable with new buildings, units, weapons, and tech.

============================================================
= 3. GLOBAL GAME RULES
============================================================

## RESOURCE FLOW
- Resource nodes spawn randomly on maps.

- Units spawn at designated points.

## COMBAT RESOLUTION
- Units and buildings implement IAttackable and IHasHealth.
- WeaponComponent handles firing logic.
- Projectiles use pooling.
- Soft counter system (stat-driven).

## BUILDING PLACEMENT
- BuildPlacementManager validates placement.
- ConstructionSite consumes resources over time.
- Completed buildings replace the site.
