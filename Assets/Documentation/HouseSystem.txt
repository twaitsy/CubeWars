CubeWars House Building System
==============================

Overview
- New `House` building type inherits from `Building`.
- Houses are used by civilians when they need sleep.

House Stats
- prestige
- comfort
- storage
- maxInhabitants
- civilians (runtime list of current residents)

Resident Flow
1) Civilian gets tired.
2) Civilian searches nearest same-team house with free space.
3) Civilian enters house and is added to resident list.
4) Civilian sleeps and then resumes normal tasks.

Inspector Support
- Selecting a House now shows:
  - Prestige
  - Comfort
  - Storage
  - Inhabitants count
  - Resident civilian names

Notes
- If no house exists, civilians cannot recover tiredness and may suffer exhaustion damage.
- A house must belong to the same team as the civilian.


Latest notes
- Houses now self-register in a global runtime list used for resident allocation.
- New houses are given randomized names (prefix/suffix + serial) at runtime for easier inspector identification.
- Civilians are allocated to available same-team houses using the runtime house register before sleep/idle movement logic.

Unified jobs/tools + housing interactions (latest)
- House storage is now receive-only for hauling flow (drop-off destination).
- House residents can still consume food directly from their own house storage while resting.
- Idle civilians (JobType=Idle) remain near their assigned house and periodically wander in a short radius.
- House stat buffs on residents:
  - Prestige: +10% movement speed per level.
  - Comfort: -10% tiredness accumulation rate per level.
