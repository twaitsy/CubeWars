Notes
- DiplomacyManager should have "Initialize All Teams At War" enabled unless manually configured.
- BuildPlacementManager must have constructionSitePrefab assigned when useConstructionSites is true.
- Every combat unit prefab should include UnitCombatController and Attackable.
- Every civilian prefab should include Civilian + NavMeshAgent.
- ProjectilePool must exist so pooled projectiles are reused.
- Resource nodes require ResourceNode and rely on ResourceRegistry for discovery.
