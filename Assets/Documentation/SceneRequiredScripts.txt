- BuildGridManager
- ResourceRegistry

- Minimap
- IMGUIInputBlocker
- TaskBoardUI (if using civilian role/task management UI)

Scene camera/input scripts

Team setup scripts (at least one)
- TeamBootstrap OR SixTeamBootstrap OR HQSpawner

Notes
- DiplomacyManager should have "Initialize All Teams At War" enabled unless manually configured.
- BuildPlacementManager must have constructionSitePrefab assigned when useConstructionSites is true.
- Every combat unit prefab should include UnitCombatController and Attackable.
- Every civilian prefab should include Civilian + NavMeshAgent.
- ProjectilePool must exist so pooled projectiles are reused.
- Resource nodes require ResourceNode and rely on ResourceRegistry for discovery.

- Civilians assigned to crafting need matching CivilianJobType (Blacksmith, Carpenter, Farmer, Cook, Engineer) for recipe.requiredJobType.
- Crafting buildings should define inputSlot, outputSlot, workPoints[], throughput caps, and recipe batches for full logistics behavior.

RTS control/combat modernization additions
- SelectionManager (updated: drag-select, shift add/remove, contextual right-click command routing)
- UnitManager (updated: formation offset utility for group move spacing)
- UnitCombatController (updated: visionRange, behaviorState, attack-move handling, stance-aware auto-acquire)
- CombatManager (updated: default vision/combatant configuration)
- ProjectilePool + Projectile (updated: consistent pooled projectile motion/impact timing)
- Selectable (updated: selected + hover indicator support)
- UnitInspectorUI (updated: combat debug fields + robust HQ diplomacy panel lookup)
- MainMenuUI (updated: team/diplomacy match setup screen)

Prefab/component notes for updated behavior
- Combat unit prefab should include: Unit, Attackable, UnitCombatController, WeaponComponent, NavMeshAgent, Selectable.
- Civilian prefab should include: Civilian, NavMeshAgent, Selectable.
- Selectable can optionally reference:
  - selectionRing
  - hoverRing
  - attackRangeCircle
  - visionRangeCircle
- Attackable can optionally reference flashRenderer for damage flash feedback.
