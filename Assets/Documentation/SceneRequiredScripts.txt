CubeWars - Required Scene Scripts Before Gameplay

Core bootstrap/system scripts (required)
- GameManager
- TeamStorageManager
- TeamResources
- DiplomacyManager
- BuildPlacementManager
- BuildGridManager
- ResourceRegistry
- CraftingSystem (legacy API support, optional if still crafting ToolItem assets)

Common global managers (recommended / used by existing systems)
- SaveLoadManager
- EventManager
- AIManager
- UnitManager
- CombatManager
- TeamColorManager
- WinConditionManager

Production-chain building scripts (required if using crafting economy)
- CraftingBuilding
- ProductionStatusVisualizer (optional but recommended for missing-input/full-output icons)

UI/interaction scripts
- SelectionManager
- UnitInspectorUI
- EconomyUI
- BuildMenuUI
- Minimap
- IMGUIInputBlocker
- TaskBoardUI (if using civilian role/task management UI)

Scene camera/input scripts
- RTSCamera

Team setup scripts (at least one)
- TeamBootstrap OR SixTeamBootstrap OR HQSpawner

Notes
- DiplomacyManager should have "Initialize All Teams At War" enabled unless manually configured.
- BuildPlacementManager must have constructionSitePrefab assigned when useConstructionSites is true.
- Every combat unit prefab should include UnitCombatController and Attackable.
- Every civilian prefab should include Civilian + NavMeshAgent.
- ProjectilePool must exist so pooled projectiles are reused.
- Resource nodes require ResourceNode and rely on ResourceRegistry for discovery.

- Civilians assigned to crafting need matching CivilianJobType (Blacksmith, Carpenter, Farmer, Cook, Engineer) for recipe.requiredJobType.
- Crafting buildings should define inputSlot, outputSlot, workPoints[], throughput caps, and recipe batches for full logistics behavior.
