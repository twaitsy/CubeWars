CubeWars Master Setup Guide
===========================

Purpose
- Central setup checklist for all currently known gameplay systems.
- Use this when creating a new scene, building prefab, unit prefab, resource node, or UI shell.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Scene Bootstrap (required before gameplay)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Create one bootstrap GameObject (for example: "_Systems") and attach:
- GameManager
- TeamStorageManager
- DiplomacyManager
- BuildPlacementManager
- BuildGridManager
- ResourceRegistry
- JobManager
- ProjectilePool

Recommended global managers also used by current scripts:

Production-chain managers (required for full crafting economy):
- CraftingJobManager
- ProductionNotificationManager

Optional compatibility manager:
- CraftingSystem (keeps ToolItem crafting calls functional)
- SaveLoadManager
- EventManager
- AIManager
- UnitManager
- CombatManager
- TeamColorManager
- WinConditionManager

Camera/input/UI scene objects:
- RTSCamera
- SelectionManager
- IMGUIInputBlocker
- BuildMenuUI
- UnitInspectorUI
- EconomyUI
- Minimap
- TaskBoardUI (if using role/task tracking)

Team setup (at least one):
- TeamBootstrap OR SixTeamBootstrap OR HQSpawner

-----------------------------------------------------------------
2) Headquarters + Team foundations
-----------------------------------------------------------------
HQ prefab minimum components:
- Building
- Headquarters
- TeamVisual (recommended)

Optional but commonly paired:
- ResourceStorageContainer
- ResourceStorageProvider (for team capacity and optional starting resources)
- ResourceDropoff (if civilians should deposit to HQ)

Important:
- Building.teamID must be set for each spawned HQ.
- BuildGridManager builds per-team grids around Headquarters objects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
3) Buildable Building Prefab Setup
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A buildable structure prefab should usually include:
- Building (required for health/team/demolish hooks)
- BuildItemInstance (auto-added at runtime if missing)
- TeamVisual (if team colors are required)

If it should occupy more than one grid cell:
- Add BuildingFootprint
  - width = X cells
  - depth = Z cells
  - worldOffset/extraYRotation optional

If it provides storage capacity:
- Add ResourceStorageContainer
- Add ResourceStorageProvider
  - capacities[] for provided capacity
  - optionally enable grantStartingResources and fill startingResources[]

If it accepts resource dropoff from civilians:
- Add ResourceDropoff

If it produces units:
- Add Barracks
- Configure producibleUnits[]

If it is defensive:
- Add Turret and/or DefenseTurret
- Add UnitCombatController if required by your combat flow

Build catalog linkage:
- Create/assign a BuildItemDefinition asset
  - prefab
  - costs[]
  - buildTime
  - yOffset/placementOffset
  - category/aiPriority
- Add definition to BuildCatalog so it appears in BuildMenuUI.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
4) Construction Site Prefab
-----------------------------------------------------------------
ConstructionSite prefab requirements:
- ConstructionSite component (required)

Recommended:
- TeamVisual
- Building-like visuals/health indicator as needed

BuildPlacementManager settings:
- useConstructionSites = true
- constructionSitePrefab assigned
- reserveResourcesForSites as desired

-----------------------------------------------------------------
5) Unit Prefab Setup
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Combat unit minimum:
- Unit
- Attackable
- UnitCombatController
- NavMeshAgent
- Selectable

Civilian unit minimum:
- Civilian
- NavMeshAgent
- Selectable
- (Optional) CharacterStats for carry/harvest/build modifiers

If civilians should appear in task systems:
- Ensure JobManager exists in scene.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
6) Resource Node Prefab Setup
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Resource node minimum:
- ResourceNode
  - type
  - remaining
  - maxGatherers (limits simultaneous gather jobs)

Registry hookup:
- ResourceRegistry in scene (ResourceNode auto-registers OnEnable).

Gathering behavior notes:
- Civilians reserve gather slots on target nodes.
- When a node is full, civilians pick the next closest available node.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
7) Storage/Economy System Wiring
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Required scene components:
- TeamStorageManager
- TeamResources

Storage building wiring:
- ResourceStorageContainer handles actual per-building storage.
- ResourceStorageProvider adds/removes capacity and can optionally grant starting resources once.

Dropoff/pickup wiring:
- ResourceDropoff for valid deposit points.
- Civilians query nearest compatible storage via TeamStorageManager.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
7B) Production-chain Crafting Economy Setup
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Crafting building prefab minimum:
- CraftingBuilding (inherits Building)
- Define ProductionRecipe (inputs, outputs, craftTimeSeconds, batchSize, requiredJobType)
- Configure InputSlot + OutputSlot transforms
- Configure WorkPoints[] where workers physically stand to craft

Recommended crafting add-ons:
- ProductionStatusVisualizer (missing input / output full / no worker icons)
- ParticleSystem + AudioSource assigned in CraftingBuilding for production feedback

Worker specialization + assignment:
- Civilian now supports CivilianJobType (Generalist, Blacksmith, Carpenter, Farmer, Cook, Engineer)
- Recipe.requiredJobType gates who can operate the building
- Automatic assignment is handled by CraftingJobManager and building assignmentPriority
- Manual assignment can be performed through JobManager.AssignCivilianToCraftingBuilding(...)

Logistics workflow now expected:
1) Worker fetches required recipe input from nearest storage (cached storage lookup)
2) Worker delivers materials to building InputSlot
3) Worker moves to available WorkPoint and operates production
4) Outputs appear in building queue / OutputSlot
5) Worker carries crafted goods to nearest compatible storage

Throughput + expansion:
- Use maxWorkers, maxInputCapacityPerResource, maxOutputCapacityPerResource, craftingSpeedModifier
- Optional upgrades increase slots/speed/efficiency
- Recipes include forward-looking fields for power/fuel requirements and multi-tier chains

-----------------------------------------------------------------
8) Selection + Inspector System
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Selection flow:
- SelectionManager selects world objects.
- UnitInspectorUI receives selected object and renders contextual panels.

Demolish button behavior:
- Appears for Building selections (including child-click selections via parent lookup).
- Enabled for player-team buildings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
9) Grid + Placement System
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Required scene scripts:
- BuildGridManager
- BuildPlacementManager
- BuildMenuUI (if player build UI is needed)

Placement rules currently supported:
- Multi-cell footprint checks via BuildingFootprint (width/depth).
- Rotation (R key) affects footprint orientation.
- Optional reservation blockers via BuildCellReservation.
- Optional construction-site workflow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
10) Quick validation checklist
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Before pressing Play, verify:
[ ] Scene has all required managers.
[ ] At least one team bootstrap path exists.
[ ] HQ prefabs have Building + Headquarters and valid team IDs.
[ ] BuildPlacementManager has constructionSitePrefab assigned (if enabled).
[ ] Build catalog entries point to valid prefabs.
[ ] Buildable prefabs needing larger footprints have BuildingFootprint set.
[ ] Storage buildings have both ResourceStorageContainer and ResourceStorageProvider.
[ ] Crafting buildings have CraftingBuilding + ProductionRecipe + input/output/workpoint transforms configured.
[ ] CraftingJobManager + ProductionNotificationManager exist in scene for assignment/bottleneck alerts.
[ ] Resource nodes have ResourceNode with type/remaining/maxGatherers configured.
[ ] UI objects exist (SelectionManager, UnitInspectorUI, BuildMenuUI, EconomyUI).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
11) RTS Controls + Combat Modernization (new)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Selection + input:
- SelectionManager now supports:
  - Left click single select
  - Left-drag selection rectangle for box select
  - Shift + click/drag to add or remove from selection
  - Hover highlighting through Selectable.SetHovered
- Right-click contextual commands:
  - Ground: Move order (formation offsets from UnitManager)
  - Enemy Attackable: Attack order via UnitCombatController.SetManualTarget
  - ResourceNode: Civilian gather order via Civilian.AssignPreferredNode
- Hold A + Right Click: Attack-move order for combat units.

Unit combat behavior:
- UnitCombatController now includes:
  - visionRange (separate from attack range)
  - stance-aware auto targeting (Hold / Guard / Aggressive)
  - behaviorState debug state
  - attack-move destination tracking
  - faster target refresh (targetRefreshSeconds)
- Attack and sight circles can be toggled with R for the primary selected combat unit.

Combat responsiveness + feedback:
- Projectile uses consistent MoveTowards travel and impactDistance.
- Attackable supports optional hit flash feedback (renderer color pulse).
- Unit nav agents receive varied avoidance priority to reduce clumping.

HQ diplomacy selection fix:
- UnitInspectorUI HQ diplomacy panel now resolves Headquarters using parent lookup,
  so clicking enemy HQ colliders reliably shows team and diplomacy controls.

Main menu expansion:
- MainMenuUI now includes "Match Setup (AoE Style)" with:
  - Team rows
  - Team color (RGB)
  - AI difficulty
  - Starting resources
  - Diplomacy stance (Ally/Neutral/Enemy)
- Setup can be applied to DiplomacyManager before game start.
