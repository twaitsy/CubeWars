Food Quality / Subtype Configuration
- Assign `FoodResourceDatabase` on the prefab to define:

Gameplay Behavior
- Civilians continue their assigned jobs until needs cross thresholds.
- Hunger priority: go to best team storage with food.
- Sleep priority: go to nearest available same-team house.
- If no food/house is available long enough, civilians lose health.
