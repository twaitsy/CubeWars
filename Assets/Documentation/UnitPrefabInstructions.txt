CubeWars - Unit Prefab Creation Instructions

1) Create prefab root
- Add a root GameObject with collider + mesh/visuals.
- Add NavMeshAgent for movement.

2) Add required gameplay scripts
- Unit (set teamID defaults and health)
- Attackable (auto-resolves health/team from Unit)
- UnitCombatController

3) Optional ranged weapon setup
- Add WeaponComponent if you want custom weapon stats.
- Assign projectilePrefab and (optional) muzzle transform.
- If WeaponComponent or projectilePrefab is missing, UnitCombatController now falls back to runtime projectile spawning.

4) Layer and target setup
- Ensure the unit collider is on a layer included in other units' UnitCombatController.attackableLayers.
- Ensure enemy units/buildings have Attackable.

5) Team visuals and selection
- Add Selectable for click selection.
- Add TeamVisual (if used in your project) for team color tinting.

6) Inspector stance setup
- On UnitCombatController, choose stance:
  - Hold: no auto-acquire (manual orders only)
  - Guard: standard acquire range
  - Aggressive: extended acquire range and pursuit

7) Validation checklist
- Unit moves with NavMeshAgent.
- Unit can acquire and pursue hostile target.
- Unit fires projectile even without WeaponComponent.
- Unit appears in inspector and stance can be changed.


Latest component enforcement
- RequireComponent on Unit now enforces NavMeshAgent + UnitCombatController.
