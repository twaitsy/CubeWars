CubeWars Civilian Needs System
=============================

Overview
- Civilians now track two survival needs:
  - Hunger
  - Tiredness
- Needs increase over time and can damage/kill civilians if ignored.

How It Works
1) Hunger increases by `hungerRatePerSecond`.
2) Tiredness increases by `tirednessRatePerSecond`.
3) When hunger passes `seekFoodThreshold01 * maxHunger`, the civilian pauses normal work and looks for food.
4) When tiredness passes `seekSleepThreshold01 * maxTiredness`, the civilian pauses normal work and looks for a house.
5) If hunger reaches `maxHunger`, the civilian takes starvation damage every second.
6) If tiredness reaches `maxTiredness`, the civilian takes exhaustion damage every second.

Food Behavior
- Civilians move to the best available storage that contains valid food resources.
- They withdraw `foodToEatPerMeal` units (or less if limited).
- After `eatDurationSeconds`, hunger is reduced by food quality * amount consumed.

Sleep Behavior
- Civilians move to the closest house on their team with available slots.
- They sleep for `sleepDurationSeconds`.
- Tiredness decreases while sleeping and is fully reset after sleep completes.

Prefab Configuration (Civilian.prefab)
- Needs - Food:
  - foodDatabase
  - hungerRatePerSecond
  - maxHunger
  - seekFoodThreshold01
  - foodToEatPerMeal
  - eatDurationSeconds
  - starvationDamagePerSecond
- Needs - Sleep:
  - tirednessRatePerSecond
  - maxTiredness
  - seekSleepThreshold01
  - sleepDurationSeconds
  - exhaustionDamagePerSecond

Inspector Visibility
- UnitInspectorUI now shows:
  - Current hunger / max hunger
  - Current tiredness / max tiredness
  - Assigned house
  - Needs rates and food-per-meal values in Stats tab

Latest behavior updates
- Sleep/rest now also attempts to reduce hunger using food from the civilian's assigned house storage.
- House comfort modifies tiredness accumulation continuously while the civilian is assigned to that house.
- Food search excludes storages that are not allowed to supply resources via flow mode.


Update: category-based food logic
- Civilians now treat any resource in `ResourceCategory.Food` (from ResourcesDatabase) as edible.
- Food choice scoring is simplified to favor nearby/high-stock storages (plus house-local bonus).
- Hunger restoration is now 1 hunger point per consumed food unit (uniform per food category item).
