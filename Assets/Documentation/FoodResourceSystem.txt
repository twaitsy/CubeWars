CubeWars Food Resource System
=============================

Purpose
- Adds a reusable food subtype layer so food resources can be ranked and expanded.
- Supports future crafting chains where basic food can be refined into better food.

Core Asset
- `FoodResourceDatabase` (ScriptableObject, script path: `Assets/Data/DatabaseScripts/FoodResourceDatabase.cs`)
- Each entry defines:
  - ResourceType
  - hungerRestore (how much hunger one unit removes)
  - ranking (preference priority)

Default Food Entries
- Food
- Flour
- Bread

Civilian Food Selection Logic
- Civilians scan team storages for resources listed as food in the database.
- Candidate score uses:
  - Hunger restore value (strong weight)
  - Ranking value
  - Distance penalty
- Highest score wins.

Result
- Civilians naturally prioritize higher quality foods (for example Bread over base Food)
  while still considering travel distance.

Extending the System
1) Create or edit a FoodResourceDatabase asset (recommended location: `Assets/Data/Databases/`).
2) Add new ResourceType entries intended as edible resources.
3) Tune hungerRestore and ranking.
4) Assign the database on Civilian prefab(s).
