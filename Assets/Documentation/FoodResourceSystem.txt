CubeWars Food Resource System
=============================

Purpose
- Adds a fully data-driven food layer built on top of `ResourceDefinition`.
- Lets gameplay tune hunger restoration, eat time, cooking requirements, and spoilage per edible resource.

Core Assets
- `FoodDefinition` (serializable data class, script path: `Assets/Data/Definitions/FoodDefinition.cs`)
- `FoodDatabase` (ScriptableObject, script path: `Assets/Data/DatabaseScripts/FoodDatabase.cs`)

Each `FoodDefinition` entry maps one `ResourceDefinition` and includes:
- hungerRestore (how much hunger one unit removes)
- eatTimeSeconds (per-food eating duration override)
- cooking requirements (optional)
- spoilage settings (optional)

Civilian Food Selection Logic
- Civilians iterate `FoodDatabase` entries instead of hard-coded enum lists.
- Food candidates are resolved from `FoodDefinition.resource` and then matched to storage items.
- Candidate score favors higher restore values and nearby storage.

Setup
1) Create/edit a `FoodDatabase` asset (recommended: `Assets/Data/Databases/`).
2) Add `FoodDefinition` rows that reference edible `ResourceDefinition` assets.
3) Assign `ResourcesDatabase` and `FoodDatabase` on Civilian prefab(s).
4) Keep `ResourceDefinition.id` aligned with runtime storage tokens for pickup/withdraw compatibility.

Migration notes
- Legacy `FoodResourceDatabase` has been replaced by `FoodDatabase`.
- Food behavior now resolves data through `ResourceDefinition` references, not food enums.
